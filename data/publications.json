    "description": "The chapter goes into quite an in-depth review of each of the proposed architectures which have been very precisely screened by us and also do quite a lot to develop a concrete sense of each one of these taxonomies by putting each of them under scanning through various evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the chapter issues several future scopes and recommendations from the perspective of the authors to ignite the thought of the ones interested in pushing this field into further sub-stratum.",
